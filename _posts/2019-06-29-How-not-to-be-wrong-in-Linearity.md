How not to be Wrong - Part I - Linearity
=====
This one word tends to cloud our judgements most of the time. Before I take you
on to this demystifaction ride of interpreting too much I suggest that some of
us need to know this "jargon". Know means "really know".

Line and Curve in Chapter One - Less Like Sweden
------
Jordan has been very kind to make us understand Lines and Curves with the help of
examples and plots. He shares his observations on debates and differing
perceptions on the matter of taxation. 


We can wear our respective hats and derive the meaning out of a line or a
curve. Fixating our views on lines might not result in satisfaction because the
real world is non linear. Numbers and plots if presented without critical
analysis might result in unintended consequences too. Mathematics is
really about critical thinking, questioning, making changes to our inferences
and communicating it with the help of diagrams.

I am not new to Lines and curves,nevertheless I have shown those in images
below. The things that I want to compare are to be quantified (using real
numbers) and to be plotted against each other with the help of something we
call axes. i.e. Horizontal axis is called `X` and the vertical one is called `Y`.

`X` and `Y` are called with some more names such as dimensions, features,
columns etc. There is nothing to get confused or scared with these names as
long as we can sucessfully communicate our point.

However, I need to remind myself that I can compare only 02 variables at a time with
the help of a line/curve in a two dimensinal space to find out

> *where I am and decide where to go*

Where I am means "The Present" and where to go means "Future". If I follow
a line it will take me in one direction but if at any point in time I feel that
there is too much or too little in case of `Y` then I can safely use Curve,
as it has the highest point.

Ok It was easy to understand `X` and `Y` then what is next? I am wondering what
to chose as `X` and what to chose as `Y`. `X` is something that you have
control on and `Y` is something that you expect to change because you are
changing `X`. If I could plot **Present** and **Future** in terms of `X` and
`Y`then I will keep **Present as X and future as Y**.


*Note: I have intentionally kept capital X and capital Y as notations*

I read this chapter of the book to know about taxation and how mathematics
helps officials, leaders, politicians and economists in *taking decisions*.

Well just because I mentioned it above, it does not mean that a line or
a curve is enough to uncover insights and *decision making*.


Digging deeper.


Calculus in Chapter 2 - Straight Locally and Curved Globally
---------------
In this chapter, Jordan has communicated that thinking of curve as a line is
not that bad afterall. Our perceptions are limited to how much we see.

Let us say I go for a walk on the street after dinner to burn some calories
and plot the path on a piece of paper to analyse the route; I will
probably not get a straigt line. However, if I plot only one step on the
paper then I will get a straight line(in any direction). 

> *X is latitude and Y is longitude here.*

Now if I want to plot the relationship between no of calories I burn in a
day and the weight over a period of one week then I might not get a
straight line.  However, if I zoom in my view and observe relationship
between burnt calories and weight for every minute of my activity hour on a
particular day, I might see a line as shown below:

#TODO: 

On any day looking at the line over an hour of activity is enough to deduce
that burning calories is good because it results in weight loss, burning more
of calories is even better. We tend to think linearly and in a way it is fine
to say that all curves are straight lines.

In the book, Jordan helps me in understanding the difference/similarity by
sharing the story of Archimedes, who took an approach called *the method of
exhaution*, to calculate the area of a circle(Curve) using inscribed and
circumscribed polygons with 65,536 sides(lines). Why at that time Archimedes
took this approach ? Because it was doable with the methods available to
Archimedes.

#TODO: image of circumscribed and inscribed ploygons

Before getting to know about the section on *calculus*, I would like to quote
another example from the book.

> *An ant on the circle, aware of his own tiny immediate surroundings, would
think he was on a straight line, just as a person on the surface of the earth
(unless he/she is clever enough to watch objects crest the horizon as they
approach from afar) feels like he/she is standing on a plane.*

Jordan teaches calculus, in one page, by giving the example of the a fired
missile's arc.  He asks to take a conceptual leap and reduce our field of view
until it's *infinitesimal* - so small that it cannot be named but not zero on
the arc and voila! the arc becomes a line.

#TODO: image of the missile arc

> *The slope of this line what **Newton** called the fluxion, and what we would now
call the derivative.*

I read the chapter to know about *fluxions*, the evanescent increments and to
know why they are called *the ghosts of departed quantities*. 

I too am going to mention the derivatives and their use when I post about how
they are useful in calculating *gradient descent* while training a neural
network.

Calculus works and a real life example from the book below:

> *If you swing a rock in a loop around your head and suddenly release it,
it'll shoot off along a linear trajectory at constant speed, exactly in the
direction that calculus says the rock is moving at the precise moment you let
go.

These evanescent increments and associated unnecessary perplexities are
explained with the help of Zeno's paradox on going to an ice cream parlour, but
never reaching it, and Grandi's series. I could understand `0.9999....`
riddle. Going further I got to know that there's a whole field of mathematics
that specializes in contemplating numbers of this kind, called *nonstandard
analysis*. Cauchy's contribution to make Newton's calculus  completely rigorous
is commendable and was convincing enough to understand that we need to make
choices in mathematics too. There are times when we have to settle the conflict
between our intuitions.

Coming back to Linearity in general and heading towards the next chapter.

To be continued....
